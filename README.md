An Excel addin developped by Jules Penel, strongly inspired by an existing tool from a previous company I worked at, on which I added a variety of new features which I was craving at the time. Disclaimer, it was inspired only: all the code in this addin was written from scratch during my garden leave.

This tool mainly makes one's life easier. Each features, by itself, doesn't save that much time, but in the aggregate it quickly adds up. However, you must be warned, many users of this tool end up addicted and cannot work anymore without it! Jokes aside, the larger enticing aspect is that it allows to standardize the graphs done by all users. In other words, it makes it easier to create a brand with a standardized style for all.

## Autoformatting
Allows one to quickly apply a standardize formatting, which differs from Excel's own template. The autoformatting can be reconfigured easily.

## Annotations
Why should one annotate? Talking from experience writing research papers, people have little time to spare before they lose interest. If a graph takes some time to understand, unless it is mind blowingly interesting, many people will skip it. Annotating shortens the time required to grasp how a graph is interesting.

While a picture is worth a thousand words, a graph with annotations is worth a million words.

The features in this addin allow to quickly add standardized annotations, making it ever easier to annotate.

## Ease of life
Some additional tools which have a more limited usage, but relevant on occasions


## Better copy
Charty provides a tool that allows slightly better copies from excel.
